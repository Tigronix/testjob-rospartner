It is always necessary to update your plugins, as the syntax keeps changing as and then you keep going ahead.

Here’s what I recommend to fix it:

1) npm install -g npm-check-updates

2) npm-check-updates -u

3) rm -fr node_modules

4) npm install

Basically this installs npm-check-updates globally, runs it against your package.json and updates the dependency versions. Then you just delete the node modules folder and re-install.
